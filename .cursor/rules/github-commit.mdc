For every feature or code change implemented:
- Read the current git diff.
- Summarize the changes by file/component.
- Stage and commit all changes using a clear, descriptive conventional commit message.
- Push automatically to the current branch using:
    git push origin $(git branch --show-current)
- If push fails, pull with rebase, resolve, and retry.
- Report the commit summary and push status.

Always use conventional prefixes (feat:, fix:, refactor:, docs:, chore:, style:, test:).

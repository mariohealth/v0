# Post-Commit Progress Report: Emergency Stability & Search Cleanup

This document summarizes all work completed since the last git commit (`18709fe`). Our focus was on resolving runtime crashes, repairing broken search logic, and cleaning up the project structure.

## 🛠️ Critical Fixes & Stability

### 1. Resolved Runtime Crashes
- **Fixed `getSearchSuggestions` Error**: Restored the missing helper function in `healthcare-data.ts` that was causing the home page to crash on search interaction.
- **Fixed Doctor Page Error**: Resolved a `TypeError` on the `/doctors` page by re-exporting `marioDoctorsData` and stubbing missing helper functions (`getUniqueHospitalCount`, etc.).

### 2. Search Logic Reparation
- **Fallback Trigger Fix**: Modified `lib/api.ts` to trigger mock fallbacks even when the API returns an **empty result set** `{ results: [] }`, not just on network errors.
- **Restored "Brain" & "Blood" Suggestions**: Fixed keywords so that typing "brain" (alone) or "blood" correctly yields the "MRI Brain" and "Blood Panel" suggestions.
- **Cardiology Routing**: Fixed a regression where specialty searches routed to an invalid ID (`?specialty=1`). It now correctly uses specialty names.

### 3. Build & Import Standardization
- **Removed Backup Bloat**: Deleted 5+ redundant backup directories (`src/app-backup-vercel`, etc.) that were causing 250+ duplicate type-check errors.
- **Fixed Versioned Imports**: Standardized 10+ UI components (Calendar, Form, Carousel) by removing non-standard version suffixes (e.g., `react-day-picker@8.10.1` → `react-day-picker`).
- **Framer Motion Fix**: Aligned all `motion` imports to `@framer-motion` for consistency.

## 📊 State of the Project

| Component | Status | Notes |
|-----------|--------|-------|
| **Home Search** | ✅ Working | Merges API results with reliable mock fallbacks. |
| **Procedures** | ✅ Working | All fallback procedures (MRI, Colon, Blood) resolve to detail pages. |
| **Doctors Page** | ✅ Recovered | No longer crashes; ready for real provider data. |
| **Build Status** | ⚠️ Pending | Remaining errors require running `npm install` for missing packages. |

## 🎥 Functional Verification

I've verified that procedures and specialties are correctly appearing in the autocomplete:

## 🎬 Phase 1: Fake Doctor Removal & API Readiness

I have completed the cleanup of mock data and refactored the search for real backend integration.

### Changes Made:
1. **Emptied Mock Doctors**: Removed 20+ fake doctor names from `mario-doctors-data.ts`.
2. **API-Ready Search**: Refactored `mario-smart-search.tsx` to handle cumulative results from multiple API endpoints simultaneously.
3. **Placeholder Infrastructure**: Added `searchSpecialties` and `searchDoctors` to `api.ts`, ready to be connected to real backend URLs.
4. **Limits Removed**: Eliminated the artificial 3-result limit for better search coverage.

### 🎥 Final Verification
I've verified that procedures still work via fallback, while fake doctors are gone:

**Verification Results:**
- Search "MRI": ✅ Shows procedures.
- Search "Angela": ✅ Shows NO doctors.
- Search "Cardiology": ✅ Shows Specialty suggestion, NO fake doctors.
